        <h4>Heart Beat Monitoring System:</h4>
        <p>A working prototype to detect and monitor the heartbeat rate in
            real-time using IoT. The system displays the user’s heartbeat rate on
            LCD screen in real-time. The system transmits the user’s sensed
            data to the internet for analytics and visualization.</p>
        <h4>Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wiper</h4>
        <p>It was built using an Arduino UNO board. This project was designed
            to build a car wiper that automatically detecs the rainfall intensity
            and regulates the frequency of wiper opeartion and displays the
            same on the LCD screen in real-time.</p>
